USE "jose" LIBRARY - it works faster that jsonwebtoken:  jsonwebtoken=2.6mS, jose=1.1mS


At the start of this article, I said that there are good usecases for JWT, but that they're just not suitable as a session mechanism. This still holds true; the usecases where JWT is particularly effective are typically usecases where they are used as a single-use authorization token.
***
   a) The tokens are short-lived. They only need to be valid for a few minutes, to allow a client to initiate the download.
    b)The token is only expected to be used once. The application server would issue a new token for every download, so any one token is just used to request a file once, and then thrown away. There's no persistent state, at all.
    c)The application server still uses sessions. It's just the download server that uses tokens to authorize individual downloads, because it doesn't need persistent state.
***
Just don't use JWT for persistent, long-lived data!

KEY punkts:

-require library 'jsonwebtoken';
-to sign a JWT and pass the data as object,
   use method - jwt.sign(payload, secretOrPrivateKey, { expiresIn: 60 * 60 }, (err, token)=>{
                        //jwt here: in "token" variable
                      })
 -to validate JWT - 
jwt.verify(token, 'secretstring', function(err, decoded) {
  // when isn`t valid - err & decoded=undefined
  // when valid err=undefined & decoded=userdata
}); 
 //there ara avaliable to choose symmetric/asymmetryc, algorythm

-to save a token in this app use a cookie with 'secret' attribute
